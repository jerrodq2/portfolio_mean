      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Jerrod Quintana and I am a full stack developer who loves to code and pretty much all things geek/nerdy. I'm an extremely fast learner and skilled problem solver, that has always excelled at whatever I've done, graduating in the top 5% of my high school class, and graduating with honors from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor's in Sociology, where I was on both the Dean's and President's list.</p>

      <p>Last year I decided I wanted something different and more challenging out of my career, so with my love of gaming, computers, and technology, I decided to do so by attending an immersive coding bootcamp called Coding Dojo, in the fall of 2016. During my time there, I became proficient in three full stacks and acquired everything I need to be a developer, where I was constantly at the top of my cohort. I fell in love with coding because of all the possibilites you can do and build with it, taking an idea and making something incredible out of it.</p>

      <p>I'm a nerd in every sense of the word, my favorite hobby is playing and collecting video games, both current and retro. I also love anime, comic books, regular books, practicing MMA, hunting, shooting, and running. My career as a coder/developer compliments my passions and interests, allowing me to better understand the accomplishments of the programmers that have come before me.</p>

      <p>My most recent job, was as a developer/analyst at a startup in Frisco, TX. During my time there, the things I worked on varied greatly, though I most consistently worked with SQL, with google sheets/formulas, and in the various CRMs we used. I also occasionally worked with web development and filezilla. During my time there, I demonstrated my ability to learn a new skill in my use of Google sheets and formulas. Initally I had never worked with them, but by the time I left, I was the one who not only worked on all changes/projects related to the google sheets and automation, but I fixed any issues/problems that came up, greatly streamlining the process.</p>

      <p>I am currently seeking a fulfilling career in where I can continue to learn new skills and grow as a developer. To contact me, please refer to my information in the contact tab.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Jerrod Quintana and I am a full stack developer who loves to code and pretty much all things geek/nerdy. I'm an extremely fast learner and skilled problem solver, that has always excelled at whatever i've done, graduating in the top 5% of my high school class, and graduating with honors from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor's in Sociology, where I was on both the Dean's and President's list.</p>
      <p>I decided I wanted something different and more challenging out of my career, so with my love of gaming, computers, and technology, I decided to do so by attending an immersive coding bootcamp called Coding Dojo. They taught me three full stacks and everything I need to be a developer, where I was constantly at the top of my cohort. I fell in love with coding because of all the possibilites you can do and build with it, taking an idea and making something incredible out of it.</p>
      <p>I'm a nerd in every sense of the word, my favorite hobby is playing and collecting video games, both current and retro. I also love anime, comic books, regular books, hunting, shooting, running, and practicing mma. I'm also an avid lover of dogs and all things fluffy.</p>
      <p>I am currently seeking a fulfilling career in web development where I can continue to learn new skills and grow as a developer. To contact me, please refer to my information in the contact tab </p>

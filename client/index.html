          <h3>About Me</h3>

          <p>My name is Jerrod Quintana, I am a full stack developer/engineer in the Dallas area who loves to code and pretty much all things geeky/nerdy. A few years ago I decided I wanted something different and more challenging out of my career. So with my love of gaming, computers, and technology, I decided to start by attending an immersive coding bootcamp called Coding Dojo in the fall of 2016. During my time there, I learned my first three full stacks (MEAN, Ruby on Rails, and Python) and began my journey into the world of coding, a journey i'm still on today.</p>

          <p>During my time there, I discovered a passion for coding that has only grown. I learned just how much there was to learn and just how little I knew. The more I learned the more I realized that I was just standing on the tip of a massive iceberg. Since i've started, i've continually worked on learning and growing as a developer, day by day, slowly but surely improving. My passion for the world of coding has only gotten stronger and increased my desire to be one of the best at what I do. In my experience, the greatest developers are the ones who never become stagnant or stop trying to improve, always trying to keep up with the ever evolving technologies and adapt to the environment. These are the developers that are consistently the most skilled at their craft, and these are the ones that I strive to model myself after and learn from.</p>

          <p>I'm a fully capable front end and back end developer, with my speciality being the back end. I have a very analytical mindset and thus tend to excel at problem solving and error debugging. So while I enjoy front end development, I've always enjoyed the back end more and the challenges it provides. I'm an extremely fast learner that has always excelled at whatever I've done, graduting at the top of my cohort at Coding Dojo, and in the top of my class at both Texas Tech and my high school.</p>

          <p>Like a stereotypical developer, I'm a nerd in every sense of the word. My biggest passion and favorite hobby is playing and collecting video games, both current and retro. In my spare time, other hobbies that I love include Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, anime, movies, books, hunting, shooting, running, and practicing self defense. I love learning about new technologies, and my career as a developer compliments my passions and interests, allowing me to better understand the accomplishments of the programmers that have come before me.</p>

          <p>I am not currently seeking new opportunities, to contact me or see my related sites (Github, LinkedIn), please refer to my information on the contact tab. You can also see some of my past projects with the dates of when I created them on the projects tab, as well as what I'm currently focused on.</p>

# portfolio_mean
Created approximately 12/2016

## Purpose
This is my first portfolio, created after I graduate Coding Dojo to help with the job hunt. It was built using MEAN,with css, media queries and bootstrap to be as responsive. The focus was on the back end functionality to demonstrate my skills with MEAN at the time. It was my first large scale project to do myself. Though it is deployed, it was never intended to be used in any kind of production setting, just for demonstrational purposes.
